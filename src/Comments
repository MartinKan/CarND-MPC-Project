You may want to try putting more weight on the differentials and epsi, and less on cte and speed

It looks similar to a problem I noticed with cte calculation: the equation from mpc-to-line project is not good here, try replacing cte1 - ((f0 - y0) + (v0 * CppAD::sin(epsi0) * dt)) with cte1 - (f1 - y1);

anthony-s: Try playing with delta t and N. That should improve the swerving in the lane.

guess its because your car is swaying back and forth. Waypoints are in carâ€™s coordinates. Try putting more weight on delta term in your cost function (a multiplier, for example 500).
